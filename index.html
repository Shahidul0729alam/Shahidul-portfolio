            <h3>These are the space missions to watch in 2022</h3>
            <p> SpaceX plans to fly a Starship spacecraft to orbit for the first time early next year. The company is
                targeting early March for its first Starship orbital launch, with as many as a dozen test flights to
                follow in 2022.</p>

                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>Starship consists of two elements, both of which are designed to be fully and rapidly reusable. If
                    SpaceX is able to recover and reuse Starship during this year's test flights, operational missions
                    could begin in 2023. The company plans to eventually use Starship for crewed missions to Mars. </p>
